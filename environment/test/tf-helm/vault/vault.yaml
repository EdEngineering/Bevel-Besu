  # Run Vault in "standalone" mode. This is the default mode that will deploy if

  # the "file" backend.  This mode is not highly available and should not be scaled
  # past a single replica.
  standalone:
    enabled: true

  # Run Vault in "HA" mode. There are no storage requirements unless the audit log
  # persistence is required.  In HA mode Vault will configure itself to use Consul
  # for its storage backend.  The default configuration provided will work the Consul
  # Helm project by default.  It is possible to manually configure Vault to use a
  # different HA backend.

    # Enables Vault's integrated Raft storage.  Unlike the typical HA modes where
    # Vault's persistence is external (such as Consul), enabling Raft mode will create
    # persistent volumes for Vault to store data according to the configuration under server.dataStorage.
    # The Vault cluster will coordinate leader elections and failovers internally.
