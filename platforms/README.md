There are seven folders in this **platform** directory. They are: **hyperledger-besu**, **hyperledger-fabric**, **hyperledger-indy**, **quorum**,  **r3-corda-ent**, **r3-corda** and **shared**. The **shared** folder contains various sub folders which in turn each have certain types of files that will be used as **prerequisites**. 
Users can run files from the selected folder in the platforms directory to deploy their network of choice. 

For users new to this project, please go to the readme file in the **shared** folder first. For users who have already completed the **prerequisites**, they can go to the specific DLT platform folder to read the specific readme file for more details on each platform.
