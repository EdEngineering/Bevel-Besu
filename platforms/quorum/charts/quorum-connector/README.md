## Quorum Connector Helm Chart
---
This Helm chart deploys the Cactus GoQuorum Connector, which connects to a GoQuorum node and exposes its functionality through an API server. The chart includes deployment configurations, services, config maps, and other resources required for deploying the connector.

<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
---
Before deploying the Helm chart, make sure to have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- GoQuorum platform/network should be up and running.
- Members and Validators nodes should be in running state.
- Helm installed

<a name = "chart-structure"></a>
## Chart Structure
---
The Helm chart consists of the following files:
- `deployment.yaml`: Deploys the Cactus connector as a Kubernetes deployment.
- `service.yaml`: Creates a Kubernetes service for accessing the connector.
- `chart.yaml`: Contains metadata and version information about the Helm chart.
- `values.yaml`: Defines the configurable values for the Helm chart.
- `configmap.yaml`: Creates a config map that provides plugin details for the connector.
- `helpers.tpl`: Contains custom label definitions used in other templates.
- `.helmignore`: Specifies patterns to ignore when packaging the Helm chart.

## Configuration
---
The [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum-coonector/values.yaml) file contains configurable values for the Helm chart. We can modify these values according to the deployment requirements. Here are some important configuration options:

## Deployment
---

To deploy the Quorum Connector using this Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum-coonector/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install the chart:
    ```
    $ helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
    $ helm install <release-name> ./quorum-connector
    ```
Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.

This will deploy the Quorum Connector to the Kubernetes cluster based on the provided configurations.

<a name = "verification"></a>
## Verification
---

To verify the deployment, we can use the following command:
```
$ kubectl get deployments -n <namespace>
```
Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the deployment was created. The command will display information about the deployment, including the number of replicas and their current status.

<a name = "updating-the-deployment"></a>
## Updating the Deployment
---

If we need to update the deployment with new configurations or changes, modify the same [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum-coonector/values.yaml) file with the desired changes and run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm upgrade <release-name> ./quorum-connector
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will apply the changes to the deployment, ensuring the Quorum Connector is up to date.

<a name = "deletion"></a>
## Deletion
---

To delete the deployment and associated resources, run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will remove all the resources created by the Helm chart.
