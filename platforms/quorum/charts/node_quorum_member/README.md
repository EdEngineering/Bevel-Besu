## Quorum Member Node Deployment Helm Chart
---
This [Helm chart](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/node_quorum_member) helps to deploy Quorum Member (non-validator) nodes with tessera transaction manager.


<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
---
Before deploying the Helm chart, make sure to have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- The GoQuorum network is set up and running.
- A HashiCorp Vault instance is set up and configured to use Kubernetes service account token-based authentication.
- The Vault is unsealed and initialized.
- Either HAproxy or Ambassador is required as ingress controller.
- Helm installed.


<a name = "chart-structure"></a>
## Chart Structure
---
The structure of the Helm chart is as follows:

```
node_quorum_member/
    |- templates/
            |- _helpers.yaml
            |- configmap.yaml
            |- deployment.yaml
            |- ingress.yaml
            |- service.yaml
    |- Chart.yaml
    |- README.md
    |- values.yaml
```

- `templates/`: This directory contains the template files for generating Kubernetes resources.
- `helpers.tpl`: A template file used for defining custom labels in the Helm chart.
- `configmap.yaml`: The file defines a ConfigMap that stores the base64-encoded content of the "genesis.json" file under the key "genesis.json.base64" in the specified namespace.
- `deployment.yaml`: This file is a configuration file for deploying a StatefulSet in Kubernetes. It creates a StatefulSet with a specified number of replicas and defines various settings for the deployment. It includes initialization containers for fetching secrets from a Vault server, an init container for initializing the Quorum blockchain network, and a main container for running the Quorum member node. It also specifies volume mounts for storing certificates and data. The StatefulSet ensures stable network identities for each replica.
- `ingress.yaml`: This file is a Kubernetes configuration file for setting up an Ingress resource with HAProxy as the provider. It includes annotations for SSL passthrough and specifies rules for routing traffic based on the host and path.
- `service.yaml`: This file defines a Kubernetes Service with multiple ports for different protocols and targets, and supports Ambassador proxy annotations for specific configurations when using the "ambassador" proxy provider.
- `Chart.yaml`: Provides metadata about the chart, such as its name, version, and description.
- `README.md`: This file provides information and instructions about the Helm chart.
- `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart. It includes configuration for the metadata, image, node, Vault, etc.

## Configuration
---
The [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/node_quorum_member/values.yaml) file contains configurable values for the Helm chart. We can modify these values according to the deployment requirements. Here are some important configuration options:

<a name = "deployment"></a>
## Deployment
---

To deploy the node_quorum_member Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/node_quorum_member/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install the chart:
    ```
    $ helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
    $ helm install <release-name> ./node_quorum_member
    ```
Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.

This will deploy the quorum member node to the Kubernetes cluster based on the provided configurations.


<a name = "verification"></a>
## Verification
---

To verify the deployment, we can use the following command:
```
$ kubectl get statefulsets -n <namespace>
```
Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the StatefulSet was created. This command will display information about the StatefulSet, including the number of replicas and their current status.


<a name = "updating-the-deployment"></a>
## Updating the Deployment
---

If we need to update the deployment with new configurations or changes, modify the same [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/node_quorum_member/values.yaml) file with the desired changes and run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm upgrade <release-name> ./node_quorum_member
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will apply the changes to the deployment, ensuring the quorum member node is up to date.


<a name = "deletion"></a>
## Deletion
---

To delete the deployment and associated resources, run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will remove all the resources created by the Helm chart.
