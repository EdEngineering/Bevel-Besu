## Tessera Key Management Deployment Helm Chart
---
This [Helm chart](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum_tessera_key_mgmt) helps in generating Tessera crypto.


<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
---
Before deploying the Helm chart, make sure to have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- The GoQuorum network is set up and running.
- A HashiCorp Vault instance is set up and configured to use Kubernetes service account token-based authentication.
- The Vault is unsealed and initialized.
- Helm installed.


<a name = "chart-structure"></a>
## Chart Structure
---
The structure of the Helm chart is as follows:

```
quorum_tessera_key_mgmt/
    |- templates/
            |- helpers.tpl
            |- job.yaml
    |- Chart.yaml
    |- README.md
    |- values.yaml
```

- `templates/`: This directory contains the template files for generating Kubernetes resources.
- `helpers.tpl`: A template file used for defining custom labels in the Helm chart.
- `job.yaml`: The job.yaml file defines a Kubernetes Job that runs the "tessera-crypto" container. This container interacts with a Vault server to retrieve secrets and generate tessera keys.
- `Chart.yaml`: Provides metadata about the chart, such as its name, version, and description.
- `README.md`: This file provides information and instructions about the Helm chart.
- `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart. It includes settings for the peer, metadata, image, and Vault configurations.


<a name = "configuration"></a>
## Configuration
---
The [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/crypto_ibft/values.yaml) file contains configurable values for the Helm chart. We can modify these values according to the deployment requirements. Here are some important configuration options:

## Deployment
---

To deploy the crypto_ibft Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum_tessera_key_mgmt/values.yaml) file to set the desired configuration values.
2. Run the following Helm command to install the chart:
    ```
    $ helm repo add bevel https://hyperledger.github.io/bevel/
    $ helm install <release-name> ./quorum_tessera_key_mgmt
    ```
Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.

This will deploy the tessera-key-management node to the Kubernetes cluster based on the provided configurations.


<a name = "verification"></a>
## Verification
---

To verify the deployment, we can use the following command:
```
$ kubectl get jobs -n <namespace>
```
Replace `<namespace>` with the actual namespace where the Job was created. This command will display information about the Job, including the number of completions and the current status of the Job's pods.


<a name = "updating-the-deployment"></a>
## Updating the Deployment
---

If we need to update the deployment with new configurations or changes, modify the same [values.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/develop/platforms/quorum/charts/quorum_tessera_key_mgmt/values.yaml) file with the desired changes and run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm upgrade <release-name> ./quorum_tessera_key_mgmt
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will apply the changes to the deployment, ensuring the tessera-key-management node is up to date.


<a name = "deletion"></a>
## Deletion
---

To delete the deployment and associated resources, run the following Helm command:
```
$ helm uninstall <release-name>
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release. This command will remove all the resources created by the Helm chart.
